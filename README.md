## Introduction

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication is a widely used serial communication protocol. In this project, we have implemented UART communication on the Altera DE2-115 development board. The received UART data is processed and then displayed on the 7-segment display.

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the Altera DE2-115 development board to your computer.
2. Connect the UART module to the appropriate pins on the board.
3. Connect the 7-segment display module to the corresponding pins on the board.



## Software Implementation

The UART communication and 7-segment display logic are implemented in Verilog. The Verilog code is synthesized using the Quartus Prime software.

The UART communication module reads incoming data, processes it, and provides an output to be displayed on the 7-segment display. The 7-segment display module converts the processed data into a format suitable for display.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Quartus Prime software and open the project.
3. Compile and synthesize the Verilog code.
4. Program the FPGA with the generated bitstream.
5. Send UART data from a connected device (e.g., computer) to the FPGA.
6. Observe the processed data displayed on the 7-segment display.
